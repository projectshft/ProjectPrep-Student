# The Goal
Your goal is to demonstrate (to yourself, mostly) that you have learned enough fundamentals of JavaScript and programming to be able to jump into the full time course. This is a essentially a spring board that allows you to go deeper into the waters of programming.

## Some things you should have already seen
- Dev tools
- console.log
- Data types
- Operators
- Variables
- Comparing values
- Booleans
- If...Else Statements
- Logical Operators
- Ternary Operator
- Switch Statements
- Loops
- Functions
- Arrays / Array methods
- Objects

## Quick Code Review
Try writing some JavaScript that will do the following:

1. Declare a variable that is an empty array that will eventually hold a list of students.
2. Make a student object variable (your name) that has the following properties: firstName, lastName, email, and favoriteHobbies (3 hobbies please).
3. Write a function that when invoked, will log the student object passed to it.
4. Write another function that when invoked, will log the following:
```JavaScript
`My name is _firstName_, and I like to _first hobbie_.`
```

**Note:**
_If you are struggling with this, don't worry. I will go over this after you have tried it._
